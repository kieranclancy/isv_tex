\v{1}The words of Hilkiah's son Jeremiah,\fnote{\fbackref{1:1} The Heb. name \fbib{Jeremiah} means \fbib{God has appointed me}} who was one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. \v{2}This message from the \divine{Lord} came to him during the thirteenth year of the reign of\fnote{\fbackref{1:2} Lit. \fbib{him in the days of}} Ammon's son Josiah, the king of Judah, \v{3}and during the reign of\fnote{\fbackref{1:3} Lit. \fbib{and in the days of}} Josiah's son Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and continued until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month, at\fnote{\fbackref{1:3} Lit. \fbib{until}} the end of the eleventh year of the reign of Josiah's son Zedekiah, the king of Judah.
\passage{Jeremiah's Call as a Prophet}

\v{4}This message from the \divine{Lord} came to me:

\begin{poetry}
\poeml \v{5}``I knew you before I formed you in the womb; \\
\poemll    I set you apart for me before you were born; \\
\poemlll       I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations.''
\end{poetry}

\v{6}I replied, ``Ah, \divine{Lord} God! Look, I don't know how to speak, because I'm only\fnote{\fbackref{1:6} The Heb. lacks \fbib{only}} a young man.''

\v{7}Then the \divine{Lord} told me, ``Don't say, `I'm only\fnote{\fbackref{1:7} The Heb. lacks \fbib{only}} a young man,' for you will go everywhere I send you, and you will speak everything I command you. \v{8}Don't be afraid of them, because I am with you to deliver you,'' declares the \divine{Lord}.

\v{9}The \divine{Lord} stretched out his hand, touched my mouth, and then told me, ``Look, I've put my words in your mouth. \v{10}See, today I've appointed you to prophesy about nations and kingdoms, to pull up and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.''
\passage{The Visions of the Almond Branch and Boiling Pot}

\v{11}This message from the \divine{Lord} came to me, asking, ``What do you see, Jeremiah?''

I replied, ``I see an almond branch.''

\v{12}The \divine{Lord} told me, ``You have observed well, because I'm watching over\fnote{\fbackref{1:12} The Heb. word \fbib{almond} (\fbib{shaqed}) sounds like the Heb. word \fbib{watching} (\fbib{shoqed})} my message, to make sure it comes about.''

\v{13}This message from the \divine{Lord} came to me a second time: ``What do you see?''

I replied, ``I see a boiling pot, and its mouth is tilted away from the north.''

\v{14}Then the \divine{Lord} told me, ``From the north disaster will pour out on all who live in the land, \v{15}because I'm about to summon all the families and kingdoms from the north,'' declares the \divine{Lord}.

\begin{poetry}
\poeml ``They'll come and each one will set up his seat\fnote{\fbackref{1:15} Or \fbib{throne}} \\
\poemll    at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, \\
\poeml against all of its surrounding walls, \\
\poemll    and against all of the towns of Judah. \\
\poeml \v{16}``I'll pronounce my judgments against them \\
\poemll    because of all their wickedness. \\
\poeml They have forsaken me, \\
\poemll    they have burned incense to other gods, \\
\poeml and they have bowed down in worship \\
\poemll    to the works of their own\fnote{\fbackref{1:16} The Heb. lacks \fbib{own}} hands.''\fnote{\fbackref{1:16} I.e. idols}
\end{poetry}
\passage{The \divine{Lord}'s Assurance to Jeremiah}

\v{17}``As for you, get ready!\fnote{\fbackref{1:17} Lit. \fbib{gird up your loins}} Stand up and tell them everything that I've commanded you. Don't be frightened as you face them, or I'll frighten you right in front of them.

\v{18}``As for me, today I'm making you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall against the whole land---against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. \v{19}They'll fight against you, but they won't prevail against you, because I am with you,'' declares the \divine{Lord}, ``to deliver you.''

\passage{The Broken Covenant}

\chapt{11}
\v{1}This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the \divine{Lord}: \v{2}``Listen to the words of this covenant, and convey them to the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem. \v{3}You are to say to them, `This is what the \divine{Lord} God of Israel says: ``Cursed is the person who does not listen to the words of this covenant \v{4}which I commanded to your ancestors on the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace. I said, `Obey me and do everything\fnote{\fbackref{11:4} Lit. \fbib{according to all}} that I commanded you. Then you will be my people and I'll be your God.' \v{5}As a result, I'll fulfill the oath that I made with your ancestors to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, just as is the case today.''\,'\,''

Then I answered, ``So be it,\fnote{\fbackref{11:5} Heb. \fbib{amen}} \divine{Lord}.''

\v{6}The \divine{Lord} told me, ``Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. You are to say, `Listen to the words of this covenant and do them. \v{7}For I've diligently warned your ancestors from the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt until now, regularly warning them,\fnote{\fbackref{11:7} Lit. \fbib{getting up early and warning}} saying, ``Obey me!'' \v{8}But they would not listen or turn their ear, and each of them stubbornly followed his own evil desires.\fnote{\fbackref{11:8} Lit. \fbib{follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts}} So I brought on them all the consequences\fnote{\fbackref{11:8} Lit. \fbib{words}} of this covenant that I commanded them to fulfill, but they did not.'\,''

\v{9}The \divine{Lord} told me, ``Conspiracy has been found among the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem. \v{10}They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors of old\fnote{\fbackref{11:10} Lit. \fbib{their first ancestors}} who refused to listen to my words.

\passage{The \divine{Lord}'s Instruction to His Prophet}

\chapt{16}
\v{1}This message from the \divine{Lord} came to me: \v{2}``You are not to take a wife, nor are you to have sons or daughters in this place.''

\v{3}For this is what the \divine{Lord} says about the sons and daughters who are born in this place, about their mothers who give birth to them, and about their fathers who father them in this land: \v{4}``They'll die of deadly diseases. People won't mourn for them, nor will they be buried. They'll be dung on the surface of the ground, and they'll come to an end with the sword and with famine. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the land.''

\v{5}For this is what the \divine{Lord} says: ``Don't go to a house where there is mourning, don't go to lament, nor to express sorrow to them. For I've taken my peace away from this people,'' declares the \divine{Lord}, ``as well as gracious love and compassion. \v{6}Both the most and the least important people\fnote{\fbackref{16:6} Lit. \fbib{great and small}; i.e. adults and children} will die in this land, and they won't be buried. People won't mourn for them. They won't cut themselves,\fnote{\fbackref{16:6} A Canaanite mourning practice forbidden by Deut. 14:1} nor will they shave their heads for them.\fnote{\fbackref{16:6} A common mourning practice in the ancient world} \v{7}They won't break bread\fnote{\fbackref{16:7} The Heb. lacks \fbib{bread}} for the mourner to be consoled for the dead. They won't give anyone the cup of consolation to drink for his father or\fnote{\fbackref{16:7} The Heb. lacks \fbib{father or}} mother. \v{8}Don't go to a banquet to sit with people\fnote{\fbackref{16:8} Lit. \fbib{with them}} to eat and drink.'' \v{9}For this is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: ``In this place I'm about to bring an end to the sounds of happiness and rejoicing, the sounds of the bridegroom and the bride. I'll do it in front of your eyes and in your time.

\v{10}``When you speak all these words to this people, they'll say to you, `Why has the \divine{Lord} pronounced all this disaster against us? What is our iniquity, and what is the sin that we have committed against the \divine{Lord} our God?' \v{11}Then say to them, `It is because your ancestors abandoned me,' declares the \divine{Lord}. `They followed other gods, served them, worshipped them, abandoned me, and didn't keep my Law. \v{12}You have done even more evil than your ancestors, and each one of you is stubbornly following his own evil desires,\fnote{\fbackref{16:12} Lit. \fbib{following the stubbornness of their evil heart}} refusing to listen to me. \v{13}I'll throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known. There you will serve other gods day and night, and I'll show you no favor.'

\v{14}``Therefore, days are coming,'' declares the \divine{Lord}, ``when it will no longer be said, `As surely as the \divine{Lord} lives, who brought up the Israelis from the land of Egypt.' \v{15}Rather it will be said, `As surely as the \divine{Lord} lives, who brought the Israelis up from the land of the north and from all the lands to which the \divine{Lord}\fnote{\fbackref{16:15} Lit. \fbib{he}} had banished them.' I'll bring them back to their land, which I gave to their ancestors.

\v{16}``I'm about to send many fishermen,'' declares the \divine{Lord}, ``and they'll catch them. Afterwards, I'll send for many hunters and they'll hunt for them on every mountain and hill and in the crevices of the rocks. \v{17}For I am watching all their ways; they are not hidden from my sight.\fnote{\fbackref{16:17} Lit. \fbib{from before me}} Their iniquity is not concealed from my eyes. \v{18}First I'll repay them double for their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the dead bodies of their detestable images, and they have filled my inheritance with their abominations.''\fnote{\fbackref{16:18} Or \fbib{their abominable idols}}

\begin{poetry}
\poeml \v{19}\divine{Lord}, my strength and my stronghold, \\

\chapt{18}
\v{1}The message that came to Jeremiah from the \divine{Lord}: \v{2}``Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I'll allow you to hear my words.'' \v{3}So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was doing work at the potter's wheel. \v{4}But the vessel he was working on with the clay was ruined in the potter's hand. So he remade it into another vessel that seemed appropriate to him.

\v{5}Then this message from the \divine{Lord} came to me: \v{6}``Israel, can't I deal with you like this potter?'' declares the \divine{Lord}. ``Look, Israel, like clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand. \v{7}At one moment I may speak about a nation or a kingdom to uproot it, pull it down, or destroy it. \v{8}But if that nation about which I spoke turns from its evil way, I'll change my mind about the disaster that I had planned for it. \v{9}At another moment I may speak about a nation or kingdom to build it or plant it. \v{10}But if that nation does evil in my eyes by not obeying me, I'll change my mind about the good that I said I would bring on it.

(This was also the first year of the reign of\fnote{\fbackref{25:1} The Heb. lacks \fbib{the reign of}} King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.) \v{2}This is what Jeremiah the prophet told all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem: \v{3}``From the thirteenth year of the reign of\fnote{\fbackref{25:3} The Heb. lacks \fbib{the reign of}} Ammon's son Josiah, the king of Judah, until the present time, for 23 years this message from the \divine{Lord} has come to me, and I've spoken to you again and again,\fnote{\fbackref{25:3} Lit. \fbib{getting up early and speaking}} but you haven't listened. \v{4}Again and again,\fnote{\fbackref{25:4} Lit. \fbib{getting up early and sending}} the \divine{Lord} sent all his servants, the prophets, to you, but you wouldn't listen or even turn your ears in my direction to hear. \v{5}They said, `Turn, each one of you, from your\fnote{\fbackref{25:5} Lit. \fbib{his}} evil habits\fnote{\fbackref{25:5} Lit. \fbib{ways}} and evil deeds, and live in the land that the \divine{Lord} gave to you and your ancestors forever and ever. \v{6}Don't follow other gods to serve and worship them. Don't provoke me with the idols\fnote{\fbackref{25:6} Lit. \fbib{works}} you make with your hands, and I won't bring disaster on you.' \v{7}But you didn't listen to me,'' declares the \divine{Lord}, ``so as to provoke me with the idols\fnote{\fbackref{25:7} Lit. \fbib{works}} you make with your hands to your own harm.

\v{8}``Therefore, this is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies says: `Because you haven't listened to my message, \v{9}I'm now sending for all the tribes from the north, declares the \divine{Lord}, and for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. I'll bring them against this land, against its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I'll utterly destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn,\fnote{\fbackref{25:9} Lit. \fbib{hissing}; i.e. a sign of mocking and contempt} and an everlasting desolation. \v{10}I'll destroy the sounds of gladness and rejoicing from them, the sounds of the bridegroom and the bride, the sound of the hand mill and also the light of the lamp. \v{11}This entire land will be a desolation and a waste, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.

\v{12}`Then when the seventy years have passed, I'll judge the king of Babylon and that nation, declares the \divine{Lord}, I'll judge\fnote{\fbackref{25:12} The Heb. lacks \fbib{I'll judge}} the land of the Chaldeans for their iniquity and I'll make it a desolation forever. \v{13}I'll bring on that land all the things I spoke against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied about the nations. \v{14}Indeed many nations and great kings will make slaves even of them, and I'll repay them according to their deeds, according to what they have done.'\,''
\passage{Judgment on the Nations}

\v{15}For this is what the \divine{Lord} God of Israel says to me, ``Take this cup of the wine of burning anger from my hand and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. \v{16}They'll drink, stagger, and act like madmen because of the sword I'm sending among them.'' \v{17}So I took the cup from the \divine{Lord}'s hand, and I made all the nations to whom the \divine{Lord} sent me drink it: \v{18}Jerusalem, the cities of Judah, its kings and officials\fnote{\fbackref{25:18} Or \fbib{princes}} to make them into a ruin, an object of horror and scorn,\fnote{\fbackref{25:18} Lit. \fbib{hissing}; i.e. hissing was a sign of ridicule and contempt} and a curse, as it is this day; \v{19}Pharaoh, king of Egypt, his officials,\fnote{\fbackref{25:19} Or \fbib{servants}} his princes, and all his people; \v{20}all the various people;\fnote{\fbackref{25:20} Or \fbib{the mixed company}} all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what remains of Ashdod; \v{21}Edom, Moab, and the people of Ammon; \v{22}all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and all the kings of the coast lands that are beyond the sea; \v{23}Dedan, Tema, Buz, and those who shave the corners of their beards;\fnote{\fbackref{25:23} Lit. \fbib{cut off the side}} \v{24}all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the various people\fnote{\fbackref{25:24} Or \fbib{the mixed company}} who live in the desert; \v{25}all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; \v{26}all the kings of the north near and far, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.

\v{27}``You are to say to them, `This is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: ``Drink, get drunk, and vomit! Fall down and don't get up because of the sword I'm sending among you.''\,' \v{28}And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink it, say to them, `This is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies says: ``You will surely drink it! \v{29}Look, I'm beginning to bring disaster on the city that is called by my name, and do you actually think you will avoid punishment?

\v{1}In the beginning of the reign of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah, this message came from the \divine{Lord}: \v{2}``This is what the \divine{Lord} says: `Stand in the courtyard of the \divine{Lord}'s Temple and tell those from all the cities\fnote{\fbackref{26:2} Lit. \fbib{speak to all the cities}} of Judah who are coming to worship at the \divine{Lord}'s Temple everything that I've commanded you to say to them.

\passage{Jeremiah Threatened with Death}

\v{7}The priests, the prophets, and all the people listened as Jeremiah spoke these words at the \divine{Lord}'s Temple. \v{8}As soon as Jeremiah finished saying everything that the \divine{Lord} had commanded him to say to all the people, the priests, the prophets, and all the people seized him, telling him as they did: ``You must certainly die! \v{9}Why have you prophesied in the name of the \divine{Lord} that this house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be without an inhabitant?'' Then all the people gathered around Jeremiah at the \divine{Lord}'s Temple.

\v{10}When the Judean officials\fnote{\fbackref{26:10} Or \fbib{princes}} heard all these things, they came up from the king's house to the \divine{Lord}'s Temple and sat in the doorway of the New Gate of the \divine{Lord}'s Temple.\fnote{\fbackref{26:10} The Heb. lacks \fbib{temple}} \v{11}The priests and prophets told the officials and all the people, ``A death sentence for this man, because he prophesied against this city, as you heard with your own ears!''

\v{12}Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people: ``The \divine{Lord} has sent me to prophesy all the things you heard against this house and against this city. \v{13}Now, change your habits\fnote{\fbackref{26:13} Lit. \fbib{ways}} and your deeds and obey the \divine{Lord} your God, and the \divine{Lord} will change his mind about the disaster that he told you about. \v{14}Look, I'm in your hands, so do with me what you think is good and right. \v{15}But know for certain that if you kill me, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and its residents because the \divine{Lord} really did send me to you to say all these things for you to hear.''
\passage{The Elders Remember Micah's Similar Message}

\v{16}The officials and all the people told the priests and the prophets, ``No death sentence for this man because he has spoken to us in the name of the \divine{Lord} our God.''

\v{17}Some of the elders of the land got up and told all the assembled people, \v{18}``Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign\fnote{\fbackref{26:18} Lit. \fbib{time}} of Hezekiah king of Judah to all the people of Judah, `This is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies says:

\v{19}``Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone in Judah kill him?

We're bringing great disaster on ourselves. \v{20}There was also a man named Uriah, Shemaiah's son from Kiriath-jearim, who prophesied in the \divine{Lord}'s name. He prophesied about this city and this land in words similar to those of Jeremiah. \v{21}King Jehoiakim, all his troops, and all the officials heard his words, and the king sought to kill him.

\chapt{27}
\v{1}At the beginning of the reign of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah, this message came to Jeremiah from the \divine{Lord}: \v{2}this is what the \divine{Lord} says to me: ``Make restraints and yokes for yourself and put them on your neck. \v{3}Then send messengers\fnote{\fbackref{27:3} Lit. \fbib{them}} to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon through the envoys\fnote{\fbackref{27:3} Or \fbib{messengers}} who come to Jerusalem to king Zedekiah of Judah. \v{4}Give them this order for their masters: `This is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says, and this is what you are to say to your masters, \v{5}``By my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth, mankind, and the animals that are on the face of the earth, and I give it to whomever I see fit.\fnote{\fbackref{27:5} Or \fbib{to whoever is upright in my eyes}} \v{6}Now I've given all these lands to my servant, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I've even given him the wild animals to serve him. \v{7}All the nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until his country's time also comes, and then many nations and great kings will use him as a slave. \v{8}If a nation and kingdom does not serve him---King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon---and does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I'll judge that nation with the sword, with famine, and with plague,'' declares the \divine{Lord}, ``until I've completely destroyed it by his hand. \v{9}You aren't to listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers,\fnote{\fbackref{27:9} Lit. \fbib{your dreams}} your soothsayers, and your sorcerers who say to you, `Don't serve the king of Babylon.' \v{10}They're prophesying a lie to you in order to remove you far away from your land.

\passage{Jeremiah Challenges a False Prophet}

\chapt{28}
\v{1}In that same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fourth year and the fifth month, Azzur's son Hananiah, the prophet from Gibeon, told me at the \divine{Lord}'s Temple in front of the priests and all the people, \v{2}``This is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: `I've broken the yoke of the king of Babylon, \v{3}and within two years I'll bring back to this place all the vessels of the \divine{Lord}'s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took from this place and carried to Babylon. \v{4}I'll bring back Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon to this place,' declares the \divine{Lord}, `for I'll break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'\,''

\v{5}The prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in front of the priests and all\fnote{\fbackref{28:5} Lit. \fbib{and in front of}} the people who were standing in the \divine{Lord}'s Temple. \v{6}The prophet Jeremiah said, ``May the \divine{Lord} truly do this thing!

\v{10}Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke\fnote{\fbackref{28:10} Lit. \fbib{the bar of the yoke}} from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. \v{11}Hananiah, in front of all the people, said, ``This is what the \divine{Lord} says: `In the same way, within two years, I'll break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.'\,'' Then Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.

\v{12}This message from the \divine{Lord} came to Jeremiah after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke\fnote{\fbackref{28:12} Lit. \fbib{the bar of the yoke}} from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet: \v{13}``Go and say to Hananiah, `This is what the \divine{Lord} says: ``You have broken wooden yokes,\fnote{\fbackref{28:13} Lit. \fbib{the bars of the yoke}} but you have made iron yokes\fnote{\fbackref{28:13} Lit. \fbib{the bars of the yoke}} in their place.'' \v{14}For this is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: ``I've put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. They'll serve him, and I've even given the wild animals to him.''\,'\,''

\v{15}The prophet Jeremiah told the prophet Hananiah, ``Listen, Hananiah! The \divine{Lord} didn't send you, and you are causing these people to trust in a lie. \v{16}Therefore, this is what the \divine{Lord} says: `I'm about to remove\fnote{\fbackref{28:16} Lit. \fbib{send you away}} you from the face of the earth.

\v{29}Then Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet, \v{30}and this message from the \divine{Lord} came to Jeremiah: \v{31}``Send a message to all the exiles: `This is what the \divine{Lord} says about Shemaiah from Nehelam, ``Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I didn't send him, and has made you trust a lie,'' \v{32}therefore, this is what the \divine{Lord} says: ``I'm about to judge Shemaiah from Nehelam along with his descendants.

\v{5}I put containers full of wine and cups in front of the members of the Rechabite clan\fnote{\fbackref{35:5} Lit. \fbib{the sons of the house of the Rechabites}} and told them, ``Drink the wine!''

\v{12}This message from the \divine{Lord} came to Jeremiah: \v{13}``This is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel says: `Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ``Will you not accept correction by listening to what I say?'' declares the \divine{Lord}. \v{14}``But what Rechab's son Jonadab commanded his sons about not drinking wine is observed, and they haven't drunk wine until this day.

\v{4}Jeremiah summoned Neriah's son Baruch and at Jeremiah's dictation, Baruch wrote on the scroll all the words of the \divine{Lord} that he had spoken to him.

\v{5}Jeremiah instructed Baruch, ``I'm confined and can't go to the \divine{Lord}'s Temple. \v{6}You go and read the words of the \divine{Lord} that you wrote at my dictation from the scroll.

\v{11}When the Chaldean army was leaving Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army, \v{12}Jeremiah left Jerusalem to go to the territory of Benjamin to take possession of his property\fnote{\fbackref{37:12} The Heb. lacks \fbib{of his property}} there among the people. \v{13}He was in the Gate of Benjamin, and chief officer Irijah, Shelemiah's son and the grandson of Hananiah, was there. He arrested Jeremiah the prophet, accusing him: ``You are going over to the Chaldeans!''

\v{14}Jeremiah said, ``It's a lie! I'm not going over to the Chaldeans.'' But Irijah\fnote{\fbackref{37:14} Lit. \fbib{he}} would not listen to him, and he\fnote{\fbackref{37:14} Lit. \fbib{Irijah}} arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. \v{15}The officials were angry with Jeremiah and beat him. They put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe because they had made it into a prison. \v{16}So Jeremiah came into the cells in the dungeon\fnote{\fbackref{37:16} Lit. \fbib{cistern-house}} and remained there for a long time.\fnote{\fbackref{37:16} Lit. \fbib{for many days}}

\v{17}Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah\fnote{\fbackref{37:17} The Heb. lacks \fbib{for Jeremiah}} and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house: ``Is there a message from the \divine{Lord}?''

Jeremiah said, ``There is,'' and then he said, ``You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.'' \v{18}Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, ``What offense have I committed against you, your officials, or these people that you have put me in prison? \v{19}Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, telling you: `The king of Babylon won't come against you or against this land'? \v{20}Now, please listen, your majesty,\fnote{\fbackref{37:20} Lit. \fbib{my lord the king}} and pay attention to what I'm asking you. Don't make me go back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, so I don't die there.''

\v{21}So King Zedekiah gave the order, and they assigned Jeremiah to the courtyard of the guard. Each day they gave him a loaf of bread from the bakers' street until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.

\v{1}Mattan's son Shephatiah, Pashhur's son Gedaliah, Shelemiah's son Jucal, and Malchijah's son Pashhur heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people: \v{2}``This is what the \divine{Lord} says: `Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, by famine, and by the plague, but the one who goes over to the Chaldeans will live. His life will be spared,\fnote{\fbackref{38:2} Lit. \fbib{He will have his life as a spoil of war}} and he will live.' \v{3}This is what the \divine{Lord} says: `This city will surely be given to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.'\,''

\v{4}Then the officials told the king, ``Let this man be put to death because he's undermining the efforts\fnote{\fbackref{38:4} Lit. \fbib{weakening the hands}} of the soldiers who remain in this city and that of all the people by speaking words like these to them. Indeed, this man is not seeking the well-being of this people, but rather their harm.''

\v{5}King Zedekiah said, ``Look, he's in your hands, and the king can do nothing to you.'' \v{6}So they threw Jeremiah into a cistern that belonged to the king's son Malchijah and was located in the courtyard of the guard. When they let Jeremiah down with ropes, because there was no water in the cistern---only mud---Jeremiah sank into the mud.
\passage{Jeremiah Rescued from the Cistern}

\v{7}Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch\fnote{\fbackref{38:7} Or \fbib{official}} in the king's house, heard that Jeremiah had been put in the cistern. The king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate, \v{8}so Ebed-melech went out of the palace and spoke to the king: \v{9}``Your majesty,\fnote{\fbackref{38:9} Lit. \fbib{My lord the king}} these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to the prophet Jeremiah by throwing him into the cistern. He will die where he is because of the famine since there is no more bread in the city.''

Take them with you and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies.'' \v{11}So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the palace, underneath the storeroom. He took worn out rags and worn out clothes from there, and using ropes he lowered them down to Jeremiah in the cistern.

\v{12}Ebed-melech the Ethiopian told Jeremiah, ``Put the worn out rags and clothes under your armpits under the ropes,'' and Jeremiah did as he said.\fnote{\fbackref{38:12} Lit. \fbib{did thus}} \v{13}They pulled Jeremiah with the ropes and brought him up from the cistern, but Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.

The king told Jeremiah, ``I'm going to ask you something, and don't hide anything from me.''

\v{15}Jeremiah told Zedekiah, ``When I tell you, you will surely put me to death, won't you? And when I give you advice, you don't listen to me.''

\v{16}Then King Zedekiah, in secret, swore an oath to Jeremiah: ``As surely as the \divine{Lord} lives, who gave us this life to live, I won't have you put to death, nor will I hand you over to these men who are seeking to kill you.''

\v{17}So Jeremiah told Zedekiah, ``This is what the \divine{Lord} God of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: `If you will immediately surrender\fnote{\fbackref{38:17} Lit. \fbib{go out}} to the officers\fnote{\fbackref{38:17} Or \fbib{officials}} of the king of Babylon, then you will live, and this city won't be burned with fire. Both you and your family will live. \v{18}But if you don't surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given to the Chaldeans, and they'll burn it with fire. You won't escape from their hands.'\,''

\v{19}Then King Zedekiah told Jeremiah, ``I'm afraid of the Judeans who have gone over to the Chaldeans. The Chaldeans\fnote{\fbackref{38:19} Lit. \fbib{They}} may turn me over to them,\fnote{\fbackref{38:19} Lit. \fbib{may give me into their hands}} and they may treat me harshly.''

\v{20}Jeremiah said, ``They won't turn you over.

\v{23}``They'll bring all your women and children out to the Chaldeans, and you won't escape from their hand. Indeed, you will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.''

\v{24}Then Zedekiah told Jeremiah, ``Don't let anyone know about these words and you won't die. \v{25}If the officials hear that I've spoken with you, and they come to you and say,\fnote{\fbackref{38:25} Lit. \fbib{say to you}} `Tell us what you told the king, and what the king told you; don't hide it from us, and we won't put you to death,' \v{26}then you are to say to them, `I was presenting my request to the king that I not be taken back to the house of Jonathan to die there.'\,''

\v{27}When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he replied to them exactly as the king had ordered him.\fnote{\fbackref{38:27} Lit. \fbib{according to all these words that the king ordered him}} So they stopped speaking with him because the conversation had not been overheard. \v{28}Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.

When they seized him they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed judgment on him. \v{6}At Riblah, the king of Babylon executed Zedekiah's sons right\fnote{\fbackref{39:6} The Heb. lacks \fbib{right}} before his eyes.

\passage{Jeremiah Warns the Refugees in Egypt}

\chapt{44}
\v{1}This is the message that came to Jeremiah for all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the land of Pathros,\fnote{\fbackref{44:1} I.e. in southern Egypt} saying, \v{2}``This is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: `You have seen the disaster that I brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah. Look, they're in ruins today, with no one living in them, \v{3}because of the\fnote{\fbackref{44:3} Lit. \fbib{their}} wickedness that they did, provoking me to anger by continuing to offer sacrifices and worship other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors had known. \v{4}Yet I sent all my servants the prophets to you again and again,\fnote{\fbackref{44:4} Lit. \fbib{getting up early and sending}} saying, ``Don't do this repulsive thing that I hate.'' \v{5}`But they didn't listen or pay attention\fnote{\fbackref{44:5} Lit. \fbib{turn their ears}} by turning from their wickedness and not offering sacrifices to other gods. \v{6}My wrath and my anger were poured out, and they burned in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem so that they have become a ruin and a desolate place, as is the case today.'

\v{7}``Now, this is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: `Why are you doing great harm to yourselves so as to cut off from Judah\fnote{\fbackref{44:7} Lit. \fbib{from the midst of Judah}} man and woman, child and infant from you, leaving yourselves without a remnant? \v{8}And why have you provoked me to anger by the works of your hands,\fnote{\fbackref{44:8} I.e. idols} by offering sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to settle so that you cut yourselves off and become an object of ridicule and scorn among all the nations of the earth? \v{9}Have you forgotten the evil deeds of your ancestors, the evil deeds of the kings of Judah, the evil deeds of their\fnote{\fbackref{44:9} Lit. \fbib{his}} wives, your evil deeds, and the evil deeds of your wives, that they did in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? \v{10}To this day they haven't humbled themselves, they haven't shown reverence for the \divine{Lord},\fnote{\fbackref{44:10} The Heb. lacks \fbib{for the \divine{Lord}}} and they haven't lived according to my Law and my statutes that I set before them and before their ancestors.'

\v{11}``Therefore, this is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: `Look, I've determined to bring disaster on you\fnote{\fbackref{44:11} Lit. \fbib{have set my face against you for disaster}} and to cut off all Judah. \v{12}I'll take the remnant of Judah that determined to go to the land of Egypt to settle there, and all of them\fnote{\fbackref{44:12} The Heb. lacks \fbib{of them}} will come to an end in the land of Egypt.

\passage{The Refugees Refuse to Repent}

\v{15}Then all the men who knew that their wives were offering sacrifices to other gods and all the women who were standing by---a large group, including all the people who were living in the land of Egypt in Pathros---answered Jeremiah: \v{16}``As for the message that you reported to us in the name of the \divine{Lord}, we won't listen to you! \v{17}Rather, we will keep doing everything that we said we would\fnote{\fbackref{44:17} Lit. \fbib{every word that comes out of our mouths}} by offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven\fnote{\fbackref{44:17} I.e. the Near Eastern fertility goddess Ishtar} and by pouring out liquid offerings to her just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of bread, things went well for us, and we didn't experience disaster. \v{18}From the time we stopped offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out liquid offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and we have been consumed\fnote{\fbackref{44:18} Lit. \fbib{have come to an end}} by the sword and famine. \v{19}Indeed, we\fnote{\fbackref{44:19} I.e. the women} are going to continue offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out liquid offerings to her.

\passage{Final Judgment Proclaimed}

\v{20}Then Jeremiah spoke a message to all the people, to the young men, to the women, and to all the people who were answering him: \v{21}``As for the sacrifices that you, your ancestors, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land offered in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, the \divine{Lord} remembered them, did he not? And they came to his attention, did they not? \v{22}The \divine{Lord} could no longer bear it because of your evil deeds and the repulsive things that you did. So your land has become a ruin and an object of horror and ridicule without an inhabitant, as is the case today. \v{23}Because you offered sacrifices and sinned against the \divine{Lord}, you didn't obey the \divine{Lord} and didn't live according to his Law, his statutes, or his testimonies; therefore, this disaster has happened to you, as is the case today.''

\v{24}Then Jeremiah told all the people and all the women, ``All you people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt, listen to this message from the \divine{Lord}! \v{25}This is what the \divine{Lord} of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says: `You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and acted with your hands: ``We will certainly carry through\fnote{\fbackref{44:25} Lit. \fbib{cause to stand}} on the vows that we vowed to offer sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out liquid offerings to her!'' Go ahead, carry through on your vows, and diligently do what you vowed!' \v{26}But\fnote{\fbackref{44:26} Or \fbib{Therefore}} listen to this message from the \divine{Lord}, all you people of\fnote{\fbackref{44:26} The Heb. lacks \fbib{you people of}} Judah who are living in the land of Egypt. `Look, I've sworn by my great name', says the \divine{Lord}, `my name will no longer be invoked by the mouth of any person in the entire land of Egypt, as he says, ``As surely as the Lord \divine{God}\fnote{\fbackref{44:26} MT word usually translated \fbib{\divine{Lord}}} lives{\ldots}''\fnote{\fbackref{44:26} I.e. using the \divine{Lord}'s name to confirm an oath}

\v{27}```Look, I'm watching over them to bring disaster rather than good. Every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will be brought to an end by the sword and by famine until they're completely gone. \v{28}The ones who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have come into the land of Egypt to settle will know whose message will stand, mine or theirs. \v{29}This will be a sign to you,' declares the \divine{Lord}, `that I'll punish you in this place so that you may know that my words concerning disaster against you will surely stand.'

\v{30}This is what the \divine{Lord} says: ``Look, I'm going to give Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, into the hands of his enemies and into the hands of those seeking his life, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who was seeking his life.''
