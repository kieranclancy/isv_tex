\passage{Luke's Dedication to Theophilus}

\chapt{1}
\v{1}Since many people have attempted to write an orderly account of the events that have transpired among us, \v{2}just as they were passed down to us by those who had been eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning, \v{3}I, too, have carefully investigated everything from the beginning and have decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, \v{4}so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
\passage{The Birth of John the Baptist is Foretold}

\v{5}During the reign\fnote{\fbackref{1:5} Lit. \fbib{In the days}} of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly order of Abijah. His wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. \v{6}Both of them were righteous before God, having lived blamelessly according to all of the commandments and regulations of the Lord. \v{7}They had no children because Elizabeth was barren and because both of them were getting old.\fnote{\fbackref{1:7} Lit. \fbib{were advancing in their days}}

\v{8}When Zechariah\fnote{\fbackref{1:8} Lit. \fbib{he}} was serving with his division of priests in God's presence, \v{9}he was chosen by lot to go into the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense, according to the custom of the priests. \v{10}And the entire congregation of people was praying outside at the time when the incense was burned.

\v{11}An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar. \v{12}When Zechariah saw him, he was startled, and fear overwhelmed him. \v{13}But the angel told him, ``Stop being afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John. \v{14}You will have great joy,\fnote{\fbackref{1:14} Lit. \fbib{have joy and gladness}} and many people will rejoice at his birth, \v{15}because he will be great in the Lord's presence. He will never drink wine or any strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. \v{16}He will bring many of Israel's descendants back to the Lord their God. \v{17}He is the one who will go before the Lord\fnote{\fbackref{1:17} Lit. \fbib{before him}} with the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and to prepare the people to be ready for the Lord.''

\v{18}Then Zechariah asked the angel, ``How can I be sure of this, since I am an old man, and my wife is getting older?''\fnote{\fbackref{1:18} Lit. \fbib{is advancing in her days}}

\v{19}The angel answered him, ``I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. I have been sent to speak to you and to announce this good news to you. \v{20}But because you did not believe my announcement, which will be fulfilled at its proper time,\fnote{\fbackref{1:20} Lit. \fbib{in their times}} you will become silent and unable to speak until the day this happens.''

\v{21}Meanwhile, the people kept waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed in the sanctuary so long. \v{22}But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them but remained unable to speak. \v{23}When the days of his service were over, he went home.

\v{24}After this,\fnote{\fbackref{1:24} Lit. \fbib{After those days}} his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and remained in seclusion for five months. She said, \v{25}``This is what the Lord did for me when he looked favorably on me and took away my public disgrace.''
\passage{The Birth of Jesus is Foretold}

\v{26}Now in the sixth month of her pregnancy,\fnote{\fbackref{1:26} The Gk. lacks \fbib{of her pregnancy}} the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, \v{27}to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant\fnote{\fbackref{1:27} Lit. \fbib{of the house}} of David. The virgin's name was Mary. \v{28}The angel\fnote{\fbackref{1:28} Lit. \fbib{He}} came to her and said, ``Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you!''\fnote{\fbackref{1:28} Other mss. read \fbib{is with you! How blessed are you among women!}} \v{29}Startled by his statement, she tried to figure out what his greeting meant.

\v{30}Then the angel told her, ``Stop being afraid, Mary, because you have found favor with God. \v{31}Listen! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus. \v{32}He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David. \v{33}He will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.''

\v{34}Mary asked the angel, ``How can this happen, since I have not had relations with\fnote{\fbackref{1:34} Lit. \fbib{I have not known}} a man?''

\v{35}The angel answered her, ``The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High will surround you. Therefore, the child will be holy and will be called the Son of God. \v{36}And listen! Elizabeth, your relative, has herself conceived a son in her old age, this woman who was rumored to be barren is in her sixth month. \v{37}Nothing is impossible with respect to any of God's promises.''

\v{38}Then Mary said, ``Truly I am the Lord's servant. Let everything you have said happen to me.'' Then the angel left her.
\passage{Mary Visits Elizabeth}

\v{39}Later on,\fnote{\fbackref{1:39} Lit. \fbib{In those days}} Mary set out for a Judean city in the hill country. \v{40}She went into Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth. \v{41}When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby jumped in her womb. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit \v{42}and she loudly exclaimed, ``How blessed are you among women, and how blessed is the infant in\fnote{\fbackref{1:42} Lit. \fbib{the fruit of}} your womb! \v{43}Why should this happen to me, to have the mother of my Lord visit me? \v{44}As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb jumped for joy. \v{45}How blessed is this woman for believing that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled!''
\passage{Mary's Song of Praise}

\v{46}Then Mary said,

\begin{poetry}
\poeml ``My soul praises the greatness of the Lord! \\
\poeml \v{47}My spirit exults in God, my Savior, \\
\poeml \v{48}because he has looked favorably on his humble servant. \\

\poemll    to Abraham and his descendants forever.''
\end{poetry}

\v{56}Now Mary stayed with Elizabeth\fnote{\fbackref{1:56} Lit. \fbib{with her}} about three months and then went back home.
\passage{The Birth of John the Baptist}

\v{57}When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son. \v{58}Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.

\v{59}On the eighth day they went to circumcise the child. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father, \v{60}but his mother said, ``Absolutely not! He must be named John.''

\v{61}Their friends\fnote{\fbackref{1:61} Lit. \fbib{They}} told her, ``None of your relatives has that name.''

\v{62}So they motioned to the baby's\fnote{\fbackref{1:62} Lit. \fbib{to his}} father to see what he wanted to name him. \v{63}He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, ``His name is John.'' And everyone was amazed.

\v{64}Suddenly, Zechariah could open his mouth,\fnote{\fbackref{1:64} Lit. \fbib{his mouth was opened}} his tongue was set free, and he began to speak and to praise God. \v{65}Fear came over all their neighbors, and throughout the hill country of Judea all these things were being discussed. \v{66}Everyone who heard about it kept thinking what had happened and asked, ``What will this child become?'' because it was obvious that the hand of the Lord was with him.
\passage{The Prophecy of Zechariah}

\v{67}Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:

\begin{poetry}
\poeml \v{68}``Blessed be the Lord God of Israel! \\
\poemll    He has taken care of his people and has set them free. \\
\poeml \v{69}He has raised up a mighty Savior\fnote{\fbackref{1:69} Lit. \fbib{a horn of salvation}} for us \\

\poeml \v{71}that he would save us from our enemies \\
\poemll    and from the grip of all who hate us. \\
\poeml \v{72}He has shown mercy to our ancestors \\
\poemll    and remembered his holy covenant, \\
\poeml \v{73}the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham. \\
\poeml He granted us \v{74}deliverance from our enemies' grip \\
\poemll    so that we could serve him without fear \\
\poeml \v{75}and be holy and righteous before him all of our days. \\
\poeml \v{76}And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, \\
\poemll    because you will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his way \\

\end{poetry}

\v{80}Now the child continued to grow and to become spiritually strong.\fnote{\fbackref{1:80} Or \fbib{become strong in the Spirit}} He lived in the wilderness until the day he appeared in Israel.

\passage{The Birth of Jesus}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 1:18-25)}

\chapt{2}
\v{1}Now in those days an order was published by Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be registered. \v{2}This was the first registration taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. \v{3}So all the people went to their hometowns to be registered.

\v{4}Joseph, too, went up from the city of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the City of David (called Bethlehem), because he was a descendant\fnote{\fbackref{2:4} The Gk. lacks \fbib{a descendant}} of the household and family of David. \v{5}He went there\fnote{\fbackref{2:5} The Gk. lacks \fbib{He went there}} to be registered with Mary, who had been promised to him in marriage and was pregnant.

\v{6}While they were there, the time came for her to have her baby, \v{7}and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no place for them in the guest quarters.
\passage{The Shepherds Visit Jesus}

\v{8}In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, watching their flock during the night. \v{9}An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. \v{10}Then the angel told them, ``Stop being afraid! Listen! I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people. \v{11}Today your Savior, the Lord Messiah,\fnote{\fbackref{2:11} Or \fbib{Christ}} was born in the City of David. \v{12}And this will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a feeding trough.''

\v{13}Suddenly, a multitude of the Heavenly Army appeared with the angel, praising God by saying, \v{14}``Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to people who enjoy his favor!''\fnote{\fbackref{2:14} Other mss. read \fbib{peace on earth, and favor to people}}

\v{15}When the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds told one another, ``Let's go to Bethlehem and see what has taken place that the Lord has told us about.'' \v{16}So they went quickly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby, who was lying in the feeding trough. \v{17}When they saw this, they repeated what they had been told about this child. \v{18}All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. \v{19}However, Mary continued to treasure all these things in her heart and to ponder them. \v{20}Then the shepherds returned to their flock,\fnote{\fbackref{2:20} The Gk. lacks \fbib{to their flock}} glorifying and praising God for everything they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.
\passage{Jesus is Circumcised}

\v{21}After eight days had passed, the infant\fnote{\fbackref{2:21} Lit. \fbib{he}} was circumcised and named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
\passage{Jesus is Presented in the Temple}

\v{22}When the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary\fnote{\fbackref{2:22} Lit. \fbib{they}} took Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{2:22} Lit. \fbib{him}} up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, \v{23}as it is written in the Law of the Lord, ``Every firstborn son is to be designated as holy to the Lord.''\fnote{\fbackref{2:23} Cf. Exod 13:2, 12, 15; MT source citation reads \fbib{}\divine{Lord}} \v{24}They also offered a sacrifice according to what is specified in the Law of the Lord: ``a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.''\fnote{\fbackref{2:24} Lev 12:8}

\v{25}Now a man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the one who would comfort Israel,\fnote{\fbackref{2:25} Lit. \fbib{for the comfort of Israel}} and the Holy Spirit was upon him. \v{26}It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die\fnote{\fbackref{2:26} Lit. \fbib{see death}} until he had seen the Lord's Messiah.\fnote{\fbackref{2:26} Or \fbib{Christ}}

\v{27}Led\fnote{\fbackref{2:27} The Gk. lacks \fbib{Led}} by the Spirit, he went into the Temple. When the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what was customary under the Law, \v{28}Simeon\fnote{\fbackref{2:28} Lit. \fbib{he}} took the infant\fnote{\fbackref{2:28} Lit. \fbib{him}} in his arms and praised God, saying,

\end{poetry}

\v{33}Jesus'\fnote{\fbackref{2:33} Lit. \fbib{His}} father and mother kept wondering at the things being said about him. \v{34}Then Simeon\fnote{\fbackref{2:34} Lit. \fbib{he}} blessed them and told Mary, his mother, ``This infant is destined to cause many in Israel to fall and rise. Also, he will be a sign that will be opposed. \v{35}Indeed, a sword will pierce your own soul, too, so that the inner thoughts of many people might be revealed.''

\v{36}Now Anna, a prophetess, was also there. She was a descendant of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage, \v{37}and then as a widow for 84 years. She never left the Temple, but continued to worship there night and day with times of fasting and prayer. \v{38}Just then she came forward and began to thank God and to speak about Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{2:38} Lit. \fbib{him}} to everyone who was waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
\passage{The Return to Nazareth}

\v{39}After doing everything required by the Law of the Lord, Joseph and Mary\fnote{\fbackref{2:39} Lit. \fbib{they}} returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee. \v{40}Meanwhile, the child continued to grow and to become strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favor rested upon him.
\passage{Jesus Visits the Temple}

\v{41}Every year Jesus'\fnote{\fbackref{2:41} Lit. \fbib{his}} parents would go to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival. \v{42}When Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{2:42} Lit. \fbib{he}} was twelve years old, they went up to the festival as usual. \v{43}When the days of the festival\fnote{\fbackref{2:43} The Gk. lacks \fbib{of the festival}} were over, they left for home. The young man Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. \v{44}They thought that he was in their group of travelers. After traveling for a day, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends. \v{45}When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching desperately for him. \v{46}Three days later, they found him in the Temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and posing questions to them. \v{47}All who heard him were amazed at his intelligence and his answers. \v{48}When Jesus' parents\fnote{\fbackref{2:48} Lit. \fbib{they}} saw him, they were shocked. His mother asked him, ``Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been worried sick looking for you!''

\v{49}He asked them, \red{``Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I had to be in my Father's house?''}\fnote{\fbackref{2:49} Or \fbib{about my Father's work}} \v{50}But they did not understand what he told them. \v{51}Then he went back with them, returning to Nazareth and remaining in submission to them. His mother continued to treasure all these things in her heart. \v{52}Meanwhile, Jesus kept on growing wiser and more mature, and in favor with God and his fellow man.

\chapt{3}
\v{1}Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Caesar Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, \v{2}and Annas and Caiaphas high priests, a message from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness. \v{3}John\fnote{\fbackref{3:3} Lit. \fbib{He}} went throughout the entire Jordan region, proclaiming a baptism about repentance for the forgiveness of sins, \v{4}as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,

\begin{poetry}
\poeml ``He is a voice calling out in the wilderness: \\
\poemll    `Prepare the way for the Lord!\fnote{\fbackref{3:4} Cf. Isa 40:3; MT source citation reads \fbib{}\divine{Lord}} Make his paths straight! \\

\end{poetry}

\v{7}John would say to the crowds that were coming out to be baptized by him, ``You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? \v{8}Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance! Don't begin to say to yourselves, `We have father Abraham!' because I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones! \v{9}The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.''

\v{10}The crowds kept asking him, ``What, then, should we do?''

\v{11}He answered them, ``The person who has two coats must share with the one who doesn't have any, and the person who has food must do the same.''

\v{12}Even some tax collectors came to be baptized. They asked him, ``Teacher, what should we do?''

\v{13}He told them, ``Stop collecting more money than the amount you are told to collect.''

\v{14}Even some soldiers were asking him, ``And what should we do?''

He told them, ``Never extort money from anyone by threats or blackmail, and be satisfied with your pay.''

\v{15}Now the people were filled with expectation, and all of them were wondering if John was perhaps the Messiah.\fnote{\fbackref{3:15} Or \fbib{Christ}} \v{16}John replied to all of them, ``I'm baptizing you with\fnote{\fbackref{3:16} Or \fbib{in}} water, but one is coming who is more powerful than I, and I'm not worthy to untie his sandal straps. It is he who will baptize you with\fnote{\fbackref{3:16} Or \fbib{in}} the Holy Spirit and fire. \v{17}His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor.

\v{18}With many other exhortations John\fnote{\fbackref{3:18} Lit. \fbib{he}} continued to proclaim the good news to the people. \v{19}Now Herod the tetrarch had been rebuked by John\fnote{\fbackref{3:19} Lit. \fbib{him}} because he had married\fnote{\fbackref{3:19} Lit. \fbib{because of}} his brother's wife Herodias and because of all of the other evil things Herod had done. \v{20}Added to all this, Herod\fnote{\fbackref{3:20} Lit. \fbib{he}} locked John up in prison.

\v{16}Then he told them a parable. He said, \red{``The land of a certain rich man produced good crops.} \v{17}\red{So he began to think to himself, `What should I do, since I have no place to store my crops?'} \v{18}\red{Then} \red{he said, `This is what I'll do.

Take it easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.''}\red{'} \v{20}\red{But} \red{God told him, `You fool! This very night your life will be demanded back from you.

\v{14}But the synagogue leader, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, told the crowd, ``There are six days when work is to be done. So come on those days to be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.''

\v{15}The Lord replied to him, \red{``You hypocrites!

They wanted to hand him over to the jurisdiction\fnote{\fbackref{20:20} Lit. \fbib{the power and authority}} of the governor, \v{21}so they asked him, ``Teacher, we know that you're right in what you say and teach, and that you don't favor any individual, but teach the way of God truthfully. \v{22}Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?''

\v{23}But he discerned their craftiness and responded to them, \v{24}\red{``Show me a denarius. Whose face and name does it have?''}

``Caesar's,'' they replied.

In the same way, all seven died and left no children. \v{32}Finally, the woman died, too. \v{33}Now in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be, since the seven had married her?''

\v{34}Jesus told them, \red{``Those who belong to this age marry and are married,} \v{35}\red{but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.} \v{36}\red{Nor can they die anymore, because they are like the angels and, since they share in the resurrection, are God's children.} \v{37}\red{Even Moses demonstrated in the story about the bush that the dead are raised, when he calls the Lord}\red{,}\red{ `the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'}\fnote{\fbackref{20:37} Cf.

\v{63}Then the men who were holding Jesus in custody began to make fun of him while they beat him. \v{64}They blindfolded him and asked him over and over again, ``Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?'' \v{65}And they kept insulting\fnote{\fbackref{22:65} Or \fbib{blaspheming}} him in many other ways.

\v{66}As soon as day came, the elders of the people, the high priests, and the scribes assembled and brought him before their Council.\fnote{\fbackref{22:66} Or \fbib{Sanhedrin}} \v{67}They said, ``If you are the Messiah,\fnote{\fbackref{22:67} Or \fbib{Christ}} tell us.''

But he told them, \red{``If I tell you, you won't believe me,} \v{68}\red{and if I ask you a question, you won't answer me. }\v{69}\red{But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.''}\fnote{\fbackref{22:69} Or \fbib{the power of God}}

\v{70}Then they all asked, ``Are you, then, the Son of God?''

He answered them, \red{``You said it}\red{---}\red{I AM.''}

\v{71}``Why do we need any more testimony?'' they asked. ``We have heard it ourselves from his own mouth!''

\v{1}Then the whole crowd got up and took him to Pilate. \v{2}They began to accuse him, ``We found this man corrupting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that he is the Messiah,\fnote{\fbackref{23:2} Or \fbib{Christ}} a king.''

\v{3}Then Pilate asked him, ``Are you the king of the Jews?''

He answered, \red{``You say so.''}

\v{4}Then Pilate told the high priests and crowds, ``I do not find anything chargeable in this man.''

\v{5}But they kept insisting, ``He is stirring up the people with what he teaches all over Judea, from where he started in Galilee to this place.''
\passage{Jesus is Sent to Herod}

\v{6}When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. \v{7}When he learned with certainty that Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{23:7} Lit. \fbib{he}} came from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time. \v{8}Now Herod was very glad to see Jesus, because he had been wanting to see him for a long time on account of what he had heard about him. He was also hoping to see some sign done by him. \v{9}So he continued to question him for a long time, but Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{23:9} Lit. \fbib{he}} gave him no answer at all. \v{10}Meanwhile, the high priests and the scribes stood nearby and continued to accuse him vehemently. \v{11}Even\fnote{\fbackref{23:11} Other mss. lack \fbib{Even}} Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt and made fun of him. He put a magnificent robe on Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{23:11} Lit. \fbib{him}} and sent him back to Pilate. \v{12}So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day. Before this they had been enemies.
\passage{Jesus is Sentenced to Death}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 27:15-26; Mark 15:6-15; John 18:39-19:16)}

\v{13}Then Pilate called the high priests, the other\fnote{\fbackref{23:13} The Gk. lacks \fbib{other}} leaders, and the people together \v{14}and told them, ``You brought this man to me as one who turns the people against the government. And here in your presence I have examined him and have found him `Not Guilty' of the charges you make against him. \v{15}Neither does Herod, because he sent him back to us! Indeed, this man\fnote{\fbackref{23:15} Lit. \fbib{Indeed, he}} has done nothing to deserve death. \v{16}So I will punish him and let him go.''

\v{17}Now he was obligated to release someone for them at the festival.\fnote{\fbackref{23:17} Other mss. lack verse 17} \v{18}But they all shouted out together, ``Away with this man! Release Barabbas for us!'' \v{19}(This man had been put in prison for murder and for a revolt that had taken place in the city.) \v{20}But Pilate wanted to let Jesus go, so he appealed to them again, \v{21}but they continued to shout, ``Crucify him! Crucify him!''

\v{22}Then he spoke to them a third time: ``What has he done wrong? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. So I will punish him and let him go.'' \v{23}But they kept pressing him with loud shouts, demanding that Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{23:23} Lit. \fbib{he}} be crucified, and their shouts began to prevail.

\v{24}Then Pilate pronounced his sentence that their demand should be carried out. \v{25}So he released the man who had been put in prison for revolt and murder---the man whose release\fnote{\fbackref{23:25} The Gk. lacks \fbib{whose release}} they continued to demand---but he let them have their way with Jesus.\fnote{\fbackref{23:25} Lit. \fbib{he turned Jesus over to their will}}
\passage{Jesus is Crucified}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 27:32-44; Mark 15:21-32; John 19:17-27)}

\v{26}As they led Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{23:26} Lit. \fbib{him}} away, they grabbed Simon, a man from Cyrene, as he was coming in from the country, and they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. \v{27}A large crowd of people followed him, including some women who kept mourning and wailing for him.

\v{28}But Jesus turned to them and said, \red{``Women}\fnote{\fbackref{23:28} Lit. \fbib{Daughters}} \red{of Jerusalem, stop crying for me. Instead, cry for yourselves and for your children,} \v{29}\red{because the time is surely coming when people}\fnote{\fbackref{23:29} Lit. \fbib{they}} \red{will say, `How blessed are the women who couldn't bear children and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'} \v{30}\red{Then people}\fnote{\fbackref{23:30} Lit. \fbib{they}}\red{ will begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us!', and to the hills, `Cover us up!'}\fnote{\fbackref{23:30} Cf. Hos 10:8} \v{31}\red{And if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?''}

\v{32}Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus.\fnote{\fbackref{23:32} Lit. \fbib{him}} \v{33}When they reached the place called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. \v{34}Jesus kept saying, \red{``Father, forgive them, because they don't know what they're doing.''}\fnote{\fbackref{23:34} Some mss. lack \fbib{Jesus kept saying, ``Father, forgive them, because they don't know what they're doing.''}} Then they divided his clothes among them by throwing dice.

\v{35}Meanwhile, the people stood looking on. The leaders were mocking him by saying, ``He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Messiah\fnote{\fbackref{23:35} Or \fbib{Christ}} of God, the chosen one!''

\v{36}The soldiers also made fun of Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{23:36} Lit. \fbib{him}} by coming up and offering him sour wine, \v{37}saying, ``If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!'' \v{38}There was also an inscription over him written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:\fnote{\fbackref{23:38} Other mss. lack \fbib{written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew}} ``This is the King of the Jews.''

\v{39}Now one of the criminals hanging there kept insulting\fnote{\fbackref{23:39} Or \fbib{blaspheming}} him, ``You are the Messiah,\fnote{\fbackref{23:39} Or \fbib{Christ}} aren't you? Save yourself{\ldots}and us!''

\v{40}But the other criminal rebuked him, ``Aren't you afraid of God, since you are suffering the same penalty? \v{41}We have been condemned justly, because we are getting what we deserve for what we have done, but this man has done nothing wrong.'' \v{42}Then he went on to plead, ``Jesus, remember me when you come into\fnote{\fbackref{23:42} Other mss. read \fbib{in}} your kingdom!''

\v{43}Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{23:43} Lit. \fbib{He}} told him, \red{``I tell you}\fnote{\fbackref{23:43} The Gk. pronoun \fbib{you} is sing.}\red{ with certainty, today you will be with me in Paradise.''}
\passage{Jesus Dies on the Cross}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 27:45-56; Mark 15:33-41; John 19:28-30)}

\v{44}It was already about noon,\fnote{\fbackref{23:44} Lit. \fbib{the sixth hour}} and the whole land\fnote{\fbackref{23:44} Or \fbib{earth}} became dark until three in the afternoon\fnote{\fbackref{23:44} Lit. \fbib{the ninth hour}} \v{45}because the sun had stopped shining, and the curtain\fnote{\fbackref{23:45} This curtain separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.} in the sanctuary was torn in two. \v{46}Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said, \red{``Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.''}\fnote{\fbackref{23:46} Cf. Ps 31:5} After he said this, he breathed his last.

\v{47}When the centurion\fnote{\fbackref{23:47} A Roman centurion commanded about 100 men.} saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, ``This man certainly was righteous!'' \v{48}When all the crowds who had come together for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they beat their chests and left. \v{49}But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, were standing at a distance watching these things.
\passage{Jesus is Buried}
\passageinfo{(Matthew 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; John 19:38-42)}

\v{50}Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council,\fnote{\fbackref{23:50} Or \fbib{Sanhedrin}} a good and righteous man--- \v{51}he had not voted for their plan and action---from the Jewish town of Arimathea; and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. \v{52}He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. \v{53}Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb cut in the rock, in which no one had yet been laid.

\v{54}It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was just beginning. \v{55}So the women who had come with Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{23:55} Lit. \fbib{him}} from Galilee, following close behind, saw the tomb and how his body was laid. \v{56}Then they went back and prepared spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.

\chapt{24}
\v{1}But at early dawn on the first day of the week,\fnote{\fbackref{24:1} Lit. \fbib{first of the Sabbaths}} they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. \v{2}They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, \v{3}but when they went in, they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.\fnote{\fbackref{24:3} Other mss. lack \fbib{of the Lord Jesus}} \v{4}While they were puzzling over this, two men in dazzling robes suddenly stood beside them. \v{5}While the women remained terrified, bowing their faces to the ground, the men\fnote{\fbackref{24:5} Lit. \fbib{they}} asked them, ``Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is living? \v{6}He is not here, but has been raised.\fnote{\fbackref{24:6} Other mss. lack \fbib{He is not here, but has been raised}} Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee: \v{7}\red{`The Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day.'}''

\v{8}Then the women\fnote{\fbackref{24:8} Lit. \fbib{Then they}} remembered Jesus'\fnote{\fbackref{24:8} Lit. \fbib{his}} words. \v{9}They returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven disciples\fnote{\fbackref{24:9} The Gk. lacks \fbib{disciples}} and all the others. \v{10}The women who told the apostles about it were Mary Magdalene,\fnote{\fbackref{24:10} Or \fbib{Mary of Magdala}} Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some\fnote{\fbackref{24:10} Lit. \fbib{the}} others. \v{11}But what they said seemed nonsense to them, so they did not believe them. \v{12}Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb.

\v{13}On the same day, two of Jesus' followers\fnote{\fbackref{24:13} Lit. \fbib{of them}} were walking to a village called Emmaus, about 60 stadia\fnote{\fbackref{24:13} I.e. about 7.2 miles; one Roman stadion was about 640 feet} from Jerusalem. \v{14}They were talking with each other about all these things that had taken place. \v{15}While they were discussing and analyzing what had happened,\fnote{\fbackref{24:15} The Gk. lacks \fbib{what had happened}} Jesus himself approached and began to walk with them, \v{16}but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.

\v{17}He asked them, \red{``What are you discussing with each other as you're walking along?''} They stood still and looked gloomy.

\v{18}The one whose name was Cleopas answered him, ``Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know what happened there in the past few days?''

\v{19}He asked them, \red{``What things?''}

They answered him, ``The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,\fnote{\fbackref{24:19} Other mss. read \fbib{the Nazorean}} who was a prophet, mighty in what he said and did before God and all the people, \v{20}and how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and had him crucified. \v{21}But we kept hoping that he would be the one to redeem\fnote{\fbackref{24:21} Or \fbib{to free}} Israel. What is more, this is now the third day since these things occurred. \v{22}Even some of our women have startled us by what they told us.\fnote{\fbackref{24:22} The Gk. lacks \fbib{by what they told us}} They were at the tomb early this morning \v{23}and didn't find his body there, so they came back and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who were saying that he was alive. \v{24}Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said. However, they didn't see him.''

\v{25}Then Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{24:25} Lit. \fbib{he}} told them, \red{``O, how foolish you are! How slow you are to believe everything the prophets said!} \v{26}\red{The Messiah}\fnote{\fbackref{24:26} Or \fbib{Christ}} \red{had to suffer these things and then enter his glory, didn't he?''} \v{27}Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them all the passages of Scripture about himself.

\v{28}As they came near the village where the two men\fnote{\fbackref{24:28} Lit. \fbib{where they}} were headed, Jesus\fnote{\fbackref{24:28} Lit. \fbib{he}} acted as though he were going farther. \v{29}But they strongly urged him, ``Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the daylight is nearly gone.'' So he went in to stay with them.

\v{30}While he was at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it in pieces, and gave it to them. \v{31}Then their eyes were opened, and they knew who he was. And he vanished from them.

\v{32}Then they asked each other, ``Our hearts kept burning within us\fnote{\fbackref{24:32} Other mss. lack \fbib{within us}} as he was talking to us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us, didn't they?''

\v{33}They got up right away, went back to Jerusalem, and found the eleven disciples\fnote{\fbackref{24:33} The Gk. lacks \fbib{disciples}} and their companions all together. \v{34}They kept saying, ``The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!'' \v{35}Then the two men\fnote{\fbackref{24:35} Lit. \fbib{Then they}} began to tell what had happened on the road and how they had recognized him when he broke the bread in pieces.

\v{45}Then he opened their minds so that they might understand the Scriptures. \v{46}He told them, \red{``This is how it is written: the Messiah}\fnote{\fbackref{24:46} Or \fbib{Christ}} \red{was to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,} \v{47}\red{and then repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.} \v{48}\red{You are witnesses of these things.} \v{49}\red{I am sending to you what my Father promised, so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.''}
