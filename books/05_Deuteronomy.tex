\passage{Moses Reviews God's Instructions}

\v{5}East of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab, Moses began to expound this Law: \v{6}``The \divine{Lord} our God spoke to us in Horeb. He said, `You have been at this mountain long enough. \v{7}Break camp,\fnote{\fbackref{1:7} Lit. \fbib{Turn}} get going, and proceed to the hill country of the Amorites and all the nearby places in the Arabah desert, the highlands, the foothills, the Negev,\fnote{\fbackref{1:7} I.e. the southern regions of the Sinai peninsula; cf. Josh 10:40} the coastal plains, all of the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon as far as the great river, the Euphrates. \v{8}Look! I've given you the land that lies ahead. Go in and possess the land that I, the \divine{Lord}, promised to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as to their descendants.'\,''
\passage{Moses Reviews the Selected Officials}

\v{9}``I also told you at that time that I won't be able to sustain you on my own. \v{10}The \divine{Lord} your God greatly multiplied your numbers, and today you are like the stars in the sky. \v{11}May the \divine{Lord}, the God of your ancestors, increase your numbers a thousand times more, and may he bless you, as he promised you. \v{12}How can I bear the burden of you and your bickering all by myself? \v{13}Choose for yourselves wise and discerning men, known to your tribes, and appoint them as your leaders. \v{14}You answered by saying that this plan is a good thing. \v{15}So I chose leaders from your tribes, wise and respected men, and I appointed them over you---commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. \v{16}I charged your judges at that time, `When you hold a hearing between brothers, judge fairly between a man and his brother or between foreigners. \v{17}When you hold a hearing, don't be partial\fnote{\fbackref{1:17} Lit. \fbib{don't recognize faces}} in judgment toward the least important or toward the great. Never fear men, because judgment belongs to God. If the matter is difficult for you, bring it to me for a hearing.' \v{18}I charged you at that time that you must do all of these things.''

\passageinfo{(Numbers 13:1-15)}

\v{19}``Then we set out from Horeb and walked through that vast and dreadful desert, where you observed the road to the Amorite hill country. Just as the \divine{Lord} our God ordained for us, we finally arrived at Kadesh-barnea. \v{20}I told you at that time, `You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the \divine{Lord} our God is about to give us. \v{21}Look! The \divine{Lord} your God has given the land that lies\fnote{\fbackref{1:21} The Heb. lacks \fbib{that lies}} before you. Go and possess it, just as the \divine{Lord} God of your ancestors commanded you. Don't be afraid or discouraged.'

\v{22}``Then all of you approached me and said: `Let's send out men in advance of us so they can survey the land and bring back a report to us on how we'll go up to their cities.' \v{23}Because this suggestion\fnote{\fbackref{1:23} Lit. \fbib{word}} seemed good to me, I chose twelve men from among you, one from each tribe. \v{24}Then these men set out,\fnote{\fbackref{1:24} Lit. \fbib{Then they turned}} went up to the hill county, reached the Eshcol Valley, and surveyed it. \v{25}They hand-picked some of the fruit of the land, brought it down to us, and gave a report that said, `The land which the \divine{Lord} is about to give us is good.'\,''
\passage{Israel Rebels}

\v{26}``However, your ancestors didn't go up. Instead, they rebelled against the command\fnote{\fbackref{1:26} Lit. \fbib{mouth}} of the \divine{Lord} your God. \v{27}You murmured in your tents, `The \divine{Lord} hates us. He brought us out of the land of Egypt in order to deliver us to\fnote{\fbackref{1:27} Lit. \fbib{to give us into the hands of}} the Amorites so he could destroy us. \v{28}Where can we go? Our brothers discouraged us when they said that the people are bigger and taller than we are. Their cities are tall and fortified to the sky, and we also saw the Anakim\fnote{\fbackref{1:28} I.e. a race of giants that formerly populated Canaan; cf. Num 13:22, 33; Deut 9:2} there.'

\v{29}``Then I told you, `Don't be terrified or afraid of them. \v{30}The \divine{Lord} your God is the One who will be going ahead of you. He'll fight for you just as he did in Egypt before your eyes. \v{31}In the desert you saw that the \divine{Lord} carried you like a man carries his son, on every road you traveled until you reached this place.' \v{32}But despite this, you didn't trust in the \divine{Lord} your God, \v{33}who walked ahead of you along the way to scout a place for you to pitch camp---by fire at night and cloud by day---to lead you on the way you should go.''
\passage{Entrance is Denied}

\v{34}``When the \divine{Lord} heard your complaints, he became angry and declared, \v{35}`I swear that not one man of this evil generation will see the good land that I promised to give to your ancestors, \v{36}except Jephunneh's son Caleb. He will see it and I will give to him and to his descendants the land on which he has walked because he wholeheartedly followed the \divine{Lord}.'

\v{37}``The \divine{Lord} was also furious with me because of you. He said: `You will not enter the land.\fnote{\fbackref{1:37} Lit. \fbib{land there}} \v{38}However, Nun's son Joshua, your assistant, will go there. Encourage him, for he will cause Israel to take possession of it. \v{39}Your little ones---whom you said would be taken captive---and your children who do not yet\fnote{\fbackref{1:39} Lit. \fbib{this day}} know right from wrong will enter the land.\fnote{\fbackref{1:39} Lit. \fbib{land there}} I will give it to them and they themselves will possess it. \v{40}But as for you, prepare to set out for the desert on the way to the Reed\fnote{\fbackref{1:40} So MT; LXX reads \fbib{Red}} Sea.'

\v{41}``You responded to me and said, `We have sinned against the \divine{Lord}. We will now go up and fight according to what the \divine{Lord} our God commanded.' So each man put on his weapon for battle and recklessly started out for the hill country.''
\passage{The Amorites Defeat Israel}

\v{42}``Then the \divine{Lord} told me: `Tell them not to go up and fight because I will not be in their midst, or else you will be defeated before your enemies.'

\v{43}``I spoke to you but you didn't listen. Instead you rebelled against the command\fnote{\fbackref{1:43} Lit. \fbib{mouth}} of the \divine{Lord} and went up to the hill country. \v{44}The Amorites who lived in the hill country came out to engage you in battle. They pursued you like bees do and crushed you from Seir to Hormah. \v{45}You returned and cried out in the \divine{Lord}'s presence, but the \divine{Lord} didn't hear your voice or listen to you. \v{46}You remained in Kadesh for many days. It was a long time, indeed.''

\chapt{2}
\v{1}``We turned and set out for the desert on the road to the Reed\fnote{\fbackref{2:1} So MT; LXX reads \fbib{Red}} Sea, just as the \divine{Lord} had directed me. We traveled around Mount Seir for many days. \v{2}Then the \divine{Lord} told me, \v{3}`You've walked around this mountain long enough. Turn northward \v{4}and command this people, ``You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives, the descendants of Esau who live around Seir. They will be afraid of you so be very careful. \v{5}Don't fight them, because I won't give you any part of their land, not even the size of a footprint.\fnote{\fbackref{2:5} Lit. \fbib{the treading of the calf of your foot}} I have given Mount Seir to Esau as their property. \v{6}You may buy food to eat and water to drink from them, paying\fnote{\fbackref{2:6} The Heb. lacks \fbib{paying}} with cash.''\,' \v{7}Indeed, the \divine{Lord} your God blessed all the works of your hands. He knows about your travels through this vast desert. The \divine{Lord} your God was with you these past 40 years, so that you didn't lack anything. \v{8}So we bypassed our relatives, the descendants of Esau who live in Seir. We turned through the Arabah desert from Elath, and from Ezion-geber we traveled the desert road to Moab.''
\passage{Israel Passes through Moabite Territory}

\v{9}``Then the \divine{Lord} told me, `Don't harass Moab or provoke them to war, because I won't give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their property. \v{10}(The Emites, a people as powerful, numerous, and tall as the Anakim,\fnote{\fbackref{2:10} I.e. a race of giants that formerly populated Canaan; cf. Num 13:22, 33; Deut 9:2} lived there before. \v{11}Like the Anakim,\fnote{\fbackref{2:11} I.e. a race of giants that formerly populated Canaan; cf. Num 13:22, 33; Deut 9:2} they were thought of as Rephaim,\fnote{\fbackref{2:11} I.e. a race of giants that formerly populated Canaan; cf. Num 13:22, 33} but the Moabites called them Emites. \v{12}The Horites used to live in Seir before the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, exterminated them, and settled there instead, just as Israel will do in the land of its possession, which the \divine{Lord} gave them.) \v{13}Now get going and cross the Wadi\fnote{\fbackref{2:13} I.e. a seasonal stream or river that channels water during rain seasons but is dry at other times} Zered.' And so we crossed the Wadi\fnote{\fbackref{2:13} I.e. a seasonal stream or river that channels water during rain seasons but is dry at other times} Zered. \v{14}Now from the time we left Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Wadi\fnote{\fbackref{2:14} I.e. a seasonal stream or river that channels water during rain seasons but is dry at other times} Zered was 38 years. All of that generation, the soldiers in the camp, were destroyed just as the \divine{Lord} swore they would be. \v{15}Indeed, the hand of the \divine{Lord} was against them to root them out from the camp until they were utterly destroyed.''
\passage{Israel Passes through Ammonite Territory}

\v{16}``And so all the soldiers among the people died. \v{17}Then the \divine{Lord} spoke to me, \v{18}`Today, you are about to cross the border of Moab at Ar. \v{19}When you come to the Ammonites, don't harass or provoke them to war, for I won't give any part of Ammonite land to you, since I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their property.

\v{20}```(Indeed, it was considered Rephaim\fnote{\fbackref{2:20} I.e. a race of giants that formerly populated Canaan} territory, since the Rephaim\fnote{\fbackref{2:20} I.e. a race of giants that formerly populated Canaan} used to lived there.

Num 13:22, 33; Deut 9:2} But the \divine{Lord} destroyed the Rephaim,\fnote{\fbackref{2:21} I.e. a race of giants that formerly populated Canaan} so that the Ammonites dispossessed them and settled there instead. \v{22}This is what he did for the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them. So they dispossessed them and settled there in their place, where they live\fnote{\fbackref{2:22} The Heb. lacks \fbib{where they live}} to this day. \v{23}It was the same for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza. The Caphtorites, who came from Crete,\fnote{\fbackref{2:23} Lit. \fbib{Caphtor}} destroyed them and settled there in their place.) \v{24}Get ready and set out for the Wadi\fnote{\fbackref{2:24} I.e. a seasonal stream or river that channels water during rain seasons but is dry at other times} Arnon. Look! I've given into your control Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, along with his land. Prepare to take possession by provoking him to war. \v{25}Starting today I will begin to instill fear and terror of you on the part of every nation under heaven who hears reports about you. They'll tremble in anguish before you.'\,''
\passage{Israel Defeats Sihon, King of Heshbon}

\v{26}``I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with this message of peace: \v{27}`Let me pass through your territory. I'll stay on the main road. I won't turn to the right or left. \v{28}Sell me food for cash,\fnote{\fbackref{2:28} Lit. \fbib{silver}} so I can eat and give me water for cash,\fnote{\fbackref{2:28} Lit. \fbib{silver}} so I can drink.

I'll pass through,\fnote{\fbackref{2:29} The Heb. lacks \fbib{I'll pass through}} until I will have crossed the Jordan into the land that the \divine{Lord} our God is about to give us.' \v{30}But King Sihon of Heshbon did not allow us to pass through, because the \divine{Lord} your God had hardened his spirit and made him arrogant,\fnote{\fbackref{2:30} Lit. \fbib{and emboldened his heart}} in order to deliver him into your control today.

\v{31}``Then the \divine{Lord} told me, `See, I've begun to deliver Sihon and his territory over to you. Prepare to take possession of his land.'

\v{32}``Sihon came out to meet us, including his entire army, at the battle of Jahaz. \v{33}The \divine{Lord} our God delivered him to us, so we attacked him, his son, and his whole army. \v{34}We captured all his towns at that time. We utterly destroyed every town---the men, the women, and the children---leaving no survivors. \v{35}We only appropriated the livestock for our use, along with plunder from the cities that we captured. \v{36}From Aroer on the edge of Arnon Valley and from the town all the way to Gilead, there was no city that was too strong for us---the \divine{Lord} our God delivered them all to us. \v{37}You did not encroach onto Ammonite land, the banks of the Wadi\fnote{\fbackref{2:37} I.e. a seasonal stream or river that channels water during rain seasons but is dry at other times} Jabbok, the towns in the hill country, and all the other places that were forbidden\fnote{\fbackref{2:37} Lit. \fbib{commanded}} by the \divine{Lord} our God.''

\v{1}``We set out and went up along the road to Bashan.

Do to him just as you have done to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.'

\v{3}``So the \divine{Lord} our God also delivered into our control King Og of Bashan, along with his whole army. We attacked him until there were no survivors.\fnote{\fbackref{:3} Lit. \fbib{survivors left to him}} \v{4}Then we captured all his cities at that time. There was not a city left that we didn't capture from them---60 cities in all from the region of Argob, which is part of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. \v{5}All of these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars. Furthermore, there were very many unwalled regions. \v{6}We utterly destroyed them, just as we did King Sihon of Heshbon, attacking them in every city---the men, women, and children. \v{7}But we kept for ourselves all of the livestock and plunder from the towns.

\v{8}``So at that time, we took control from the two Amorite kings the territory east of the Jordan from Wadi\fnote{\fbackref{3:8} I.e. a seasonal stream or river that channels water during rain seasons but is dry at other times} Arnon to Mount Hermon. \v{9}(The Sidonians called Hermon Sirion, but the Amorites called it Senir.) \v{10}We took control of\fnote{\fbackref{3:10} The Heb. lacks \fbib{We took control of}} all the cities of the plain, all of Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. \v{11}Only King Og of Bashan remained from the remnants of the Rephaim.\fnote{\fbackref{3:11} I.e. a race of giants that formerly populated Canaan; cf.

(The whole region of Argob---that is, all of Bashan---is called the land of the Rephaim.) \v{14}Manasseh's son Jair captured all the Argob region as far as the territory of the descendants of Geshur and the descendants of Maacath. Bashan was named after him; that's why it is called Havvoth-jair to this day. \v{15}Furthermore, I've given Gilead to Machir. \v{16}And I've given Gilead to the descendants of Reuben and the descendants of Gad as far as the Arnon Valley, designating the middle of the valley as its boundary, including up to the Jabbok River as a boundary with the Ammonites. \v{17}The Arabah and the Jordan River are also a boundary from Chinnereth\fnote{\fbackref{3:17} I.e. the Sea of Galilee} to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Salt Sea),\fnote{\fbackref{3:17} I.e. the Dead Sea} below the slopes of Pisgah on the east.''

\v{41}Then Moses designated three cities on the east side of the Jordan, \v{42}where a person who accidentally killed someone could flee, if he killed his neighbor without having enmity toward him in the past.

\passage{Moses Reviews the Law}

\v{44}This is the Law that Moses reviewed in the presence of the Israelis. \v{45}These are the instructions, decrees, and ordinances that Moses declared to the Israelis when they came out of Egypt. \v{46}He did this\fnote{\fbackref{4:46} The Heb. lacks \fbib{He did this}} east of the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and whom Moses and the Israelis defeated after leaving Egypt. \v{47}So they took possession of his land, as well as the land of King Og of Bashan. Both Amorite kings lived east of the Jordan---\v{48}from Aroer on the edge of the Wadi\fnote{\fbackref{4:48} I.e. a seasonal stream or river that channels water during rain seasons but is dry at other times} Arnon as far as Mount Sirion,\fnote{\fbackref{4:48} MT reads \fbib{Sion}; cf.

I didn't eat food or drink water because of your sin. You had sinned by committing this evil in full view of the \divine{Lord}, thereby provoking him to anger. \v{19}I feared the anger and wrath of the \divine{Lord} against you, because he was irate enough to destroy you. But the \divine{Lord} also listened to me at that time. \v{20}It was as had been the case with Aaron---the \divine{Lord} was very angry and about to destroy him, but I prayed for Aaron at that time. \v{21}So when you made the calf that made you sin, I grabbed it, burned it with fire, crushed it, and ground it thoroughly until it was pulverized to powder.

\passage{Integrity in Marriage}

\v{13}``Suppose a man marries a wife, but after having sexual relations with her, he despises her, \v{14}invents charges against her, and defames her by saying, `I have married this woman, but when I had sexual relations with her I found that she wasn't a virgin.' \v{15}Then the father of the young lady, along with her mother, is to bring evidence of the young lady's virginity to the elders at the gate. \v{16}The father of the young lady is to then say to the elders: `I have given my daughter to this man as a wife, but he despises her. \v{17}Now look, he has invented charges against her by saying, ``I haven't found your daughter to be a virgin.'' But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity.' Then they are to spread the cloth before the elders of the city. \v{18}The elders of that city will then take the man, punish him, \v{19}fine him 100 shekels of silver, and then give them to the young lady's father, because he defamed a virgin of Israel. She is to remain his wife and he can't divorce her as long as he lives. \v{20}But if this charge is true, and the evidence of the young lady's virginity wasn't found, \v{21}they are to bring her to the door of her father's house. Then the men of the city are to stone her with boulders until she dies for doing a detestable thing in Israel---acting like a prostitute while in her father's house. By doing this, you will remove this evil from among you.

\v{22}``If a man is caught having sexual relations with a married woman, then both of them must die---the man who had sex with the woman and the woman herself---so that this evil will be removed from Israel.

\v{23}``If a man meets a young virgin lady in the city who is engaged to be married and has sexual relations with her, \v{24}then the two must be brought to the city gate and there they must be stoned to death---the girl because she was in a city but did not cry out for help, and the man who abused a woman who was engaged to another man. By doing this you are to remove this evil from among you.

\v{25}``If a man meets a girl in the country who is engaged to be married and then rapes\fnote{\fbackref{22:25} Lit. \fbib{overwhelms}} her, the man alone---the one who had sexual relations with her---must die. \v{26}As for the young lady, don't do anything to her. The young lady did nothing worthy of death. This case is similar to when a man attacks his countryman and kills him. \v{27}Since he found her in the country, the engaged girl may have cried out, but there was no one to rescue her.

\v{28}``However, if a man meets a girl who isn't engaged to be married, and he seizes her, rapes her, and is later found out, \v{29}then the man who raped her must give 50 shekels of silver to the girl's father. Furthermore, he must marry her. Because he violated her, he is to not divorce her as long as he lives.

\v{19}``Now write this song and teach it to the Israelis.

I know the plan that they are devising even before I bring them into the land that I promised them\fnote{\fbackref{31:21} The Heb. lacks \fbib{them}} by an oath.''

\v{22}So Moses wrote the song that very day and taught it to the Israelis. \v{23}Then the \divine{Lord} charged Nun's son Joshua, ``Be strong and courageous, because you'll bring the Israelis to the land that I promised to them by an oath. I'll be with you.''
